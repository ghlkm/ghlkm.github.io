Keming Li is a computer science PhD student at the University of California, Irvine ([UCI](https://www.uci.edu/)), supervised by Professor [Sharad Mehrotra](https://ics.uci.edu/~sharad/). Before that, he earned his bachelor and master degree at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/)), supervised by Professor [Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/). He interned at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/) during his undergraduate studies and received a coding award. His research interests include spatial database and graph database, and he is excited to learn and apply his knowledge to solve real-world problems.

He had worked with Professor [Kyriakos Mouratidis](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/kyriakos/), Professor Bo Tang, and Doctor Jiahao Zhang on some research work. They were published in SIGMOD’21, SIGMOD’22, and VLDBJ. The work in SIGMOD’21 is to develop new query operators that combine the benefits of top-k and skyline queries and are flexible, personalized, and controllable in output size. Performance is also a challenge of this work. The work in SIGMOD’22 is to construct a space efficient index for top-k retrieval related queries, experiments of plenty queries were conducted. The work in VLDBJ aims to assess its competitiveness with regard to different possible preferences. They define measures of competitiveness, utilize heatmap to show the competitiveness, and show side-applications of the work on multi-object querying.

Currently he is a PhD student researching topic on database collecting data from IoT devices. The target of this project is to develop an intelligent IoT database answering OLAP and OLTP queries with billion scale of data.


**Teaching**. I serviced as a teaching assistant in 5 department core courses including Database, Computer Programming Fundamentals, C/C++ programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Operating Systems. I won the Southern University of Science and Technology Excellent Teaching Assistan Award at SUSTech for 2018 and 2019.

My **resume** can be found [here](/assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf). My github account is [ghlkm](https://github.com/ghlkm).
