I am a third-year master's student in computer science and engineering at the Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/)), P.R.China. I am a member of Database Group at SUSTech ([DBGroup@SUSTech](https://dbgroup.sustech.edu.cn/)), supervisored by Professor [Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/). I also work in Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain-inspired Intelligent Computation ([link](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/en/research/labView/id/152)). My research interests lie on algorithms for information retrieval, computational geometry, and graph processing, and systems for data mining and graph data.

I received my BS degree in Computer Science and Technology at SUSTech (BS 2016). I have research internship in [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com) and tight research cooperation relationship with Professor [Kyriakos Mouratidis](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/kyriakos/) who is in [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/).
