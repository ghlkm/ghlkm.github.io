I am Keming Li, a master's student in computer science and engineering at the Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/)). I am a member of Database Group at SUSTech ([DBGroup@SUSTech](https://dbgroup.sustech.edu.cn/)), supervisored by Professor [Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/). I also work in Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain-inspired Intelligent Computation. My research interests lie on algorithms for information retrieval, computational geometry, and graph processing, and systems for data mining and graph data.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
